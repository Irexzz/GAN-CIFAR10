# GAN on CIFAR-10 Dataset

A project showcasing image generation using a Generative Adversarial Network trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

# Description

This project explores the application of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating realistic images based on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, including airplanes, cars, birds, and more.

The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator, trained in tandem. The generator creates images, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity. The model is trained to improve the generator's ability to produce convincing images and the discriminator's ability to distinguish real from fake.

# Features

Implementation of a custom GAN architecture for image generation.

Data preprocessing, augmentation and normalization for optimal model performance.

Increase train dataset so that it has more images to train and increase variability and diversity of it.

Experimented with different artchitectures, amount of layers, latent space, weight initialization, label smoothing, minibatch discrimination and dropouts.

Visualization of generated images at different training epochs.

# Results

Examples of images generated by the GAN after training is in the notebook file (with explaination)

Evaluation of GAN performance using visual based on quality and diversity images

Best model - 4x4 generator with label smoothing, 100 latent space and minibatch discrimination

To Note: Need to download file to view as it is too big
